# LocalizationSample

## Environment
IDE : Xcode , Language : Swift 3

## Motivation
To improve my swift and iOS app development skills, I make some practice. Maybe someone will need to take this example as practice as well.
So I push it. Hope to help someone else.

## Project guide
It's a simple project that show the tableview and try to translate it with NSLocalization.

**Adding support for another language to your Xcode Project**

Enable to support another language, first we need to add language,
choose the language that you want to support

**Internationalization of Text using NSLocalizedString**

Add a new File to the project of type Strings and provide a name as Localizable.strings.

Select Localizable.Strings in Project Navigator and click Localize button available under File Inspector.

Now you should be able to expand Localizable.Strings under Project Navigator and see separate files for English and German.

**Extension with String**

Now, add the string which you want to translate in the Localizable.strings.
